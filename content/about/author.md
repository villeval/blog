I am a Software Engineer on the core engineering team at [Wolt](https://wolt.com). Building scalable and reliable distributed systems is something I thrive on and I'm focusing on that at Wolt as well.

Before joining Wolt, I worked at a consultation company Solita, where my focus was backend development, data integrations and designing and establishing system architectures for cloud and on-premise platforms. I graduated from the University of Jyväskylä with a Master's degree in Information Systems science and I have a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration as well.

If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach me out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/villevalt).
