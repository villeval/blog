I'm Ville, a software engineer based in Finland, who works on backend and infrastructure. Building scalable and reliable distributed systems is something I thrive on, but during my spare time I like to explore new things, usually by building something with a new technology. I vouch for open source and remote working. For more detailed information about my experience and expertise check my [Linkedin-profile](https://linkedin.com/in/vvaltonen).

Although I like coding and software engineering a lot, I don't spend all of my time on doing that. My hobbies include powerlifting, sports and motorcycling and I'm interested in economics as well.
