Hi, I'm Ville! I'm really enthustiastic about computers and writing code, so I truly appreciate the fact I get to do it as my job. I currently work in a consultation company called [Solita](https://www.solita.fi/en), where I work on building back-end software and system architectures for different clients. Building scalable and reliable distributed systems is something I thrive on, but I'm also interested in site reliability engineering, Linux and computer science fundamentals and theory. I vouch for open source and remote working. For more detailed information about my experience and expertise check my [Linkedin-profile](https://linkedin.com/in/valtonenville1).

Although I'm very interested in coding and software engineering, I'm really enjoying things like powerlifting, motorcycling and investing.
