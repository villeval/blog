I'm a software engineer based in Finland. I work mainly on server-side software and system architectures for cloud and on-premise platforms. Besides the previously mentioned, I'm also interested in site reliability engineering, Linux and computer science. Building scalable and reliable distributed systems is something I thrive on and I vouch for open source and remote working. For more detailed information about my experience and expertise check my [Linkedin-profile](https://linkedin.com/in/valtonenville1).

Although I'm very enthusiastic about programming and software engineering, I'm also interested in powerlifting, motorcycling and investing.
