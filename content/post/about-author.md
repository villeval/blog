I'm a software engineer based in Finland. I work mainly with server-side software, cloud and system architectures, site reliability engineering and devops-solutions. I'm also interested computer science, Linux and distributed systems. I vouch for agile development, open source and remote working. For more detailed information about my experience and expertise check my [Linkedin-profile](https://linkedin.com/in/valtonenville1).

Although I'm very enthusiastic about programming and software engineering, I'm also interested in powerlifting, motorcycling and investing.
