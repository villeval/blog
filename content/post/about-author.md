I'm a software engineer based in Finland. I work mainly on server-side development, cloud and system architectures and devops-solutions. I'm also interested in things like computer science and fundamentals, Linux and distributed systems. I vouch for agile development, devops-culture, open source and automation. For more detailed information about my experience and expertise check my [Linkedin-profile](https://linkedin.com/in/valtonenville1).

Although I'm very enthusiastic about programming and software engineering, I also enjoy powerlifting, motorcycling and floorball.
