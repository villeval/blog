Although I like working on server-side development, system architecture and devops, I've always been really interested in data and using it. In university I really enjoyed the courses, which had lectures related data modeling, translating data to insights or working with big data. I'm fascinated by the potential and the capabilities of data science and especially machine learning.

Therefore I've recently decided to start learn the basics of machine learning. There are many options to gain knowledge about different subjects, but since I have successful track record in learning things by myself by studying online resources, I decided to compose my own curriculum, which I can follow to learn about machine learning.

The curriculum is fairly long and it will take some time, but in the end I should have a basic proficiency in the fields of data science and machine learning. If you're interested in checking out my curriculum or even following it yourself, you can check my [Github-repository](https://github.com/villeval/ml-curriculum). Bear in mind, it's tailored towards my current experience and competence, so the emphasis on basics of programming or computer science is limited.
